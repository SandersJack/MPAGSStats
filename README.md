## Question 7 
Looking at the graphs, you would first say that plot d fits quite well with the line but this only really beacuse the errors on the values are massive. Plot a doesnt really fit as you would expect due to the very small errors in the y dimention. Plot c doesnt fit well in the center of the range and doesnt really resemble a straigh line. I would argue that Plot b is the best fit, with reasonable errors, with points distributed around the line.
